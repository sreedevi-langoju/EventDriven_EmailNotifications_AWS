# EventDriven_EmailNotification_AWS
Event Driven Notification System using Amazon S3, Lambda, SNS 

In this project, I built an event-driven architecture by harnessing the capabilities of AWS services. The process was initiated with S3 triggers, which were captured through a Lambda function. The captured data was then seamlessly passed to Amazon SNS, enabling the automated sending of customized email notifications to customers. This setup ensured timely and efficient communication with end-users and streamlined the event-based email notification process.
